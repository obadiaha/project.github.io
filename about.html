 <h2>Our Partnership</h2>
 <img src = "C:\Users\obadi\Documents\Fall 2016\INFO 202\Group Project\pictures\hope paws.png" width="85%">
 <p>We are not your regular pet hotel and spa! We worked out a special deal with a non-profit organization called Hope for Paws. Their
 mission is to raise money and awareness for those household pets who suffer and die every year because of
 negligence and abuse. Every time you buy a product, extend the stay of your pet here at RPHS, or spend any type of money in our gift store
 or for your animals medical care, 10% of the proeceds are donated to Hope for Paws to further their mission. The staff
 at Hope for Paws is extremely grateful for your contribution and ensure that the animals affected by their reach
 are just as grateful as well! For more information you can visit their website <a href="http://www.hopeforpaws.org/">here</a>.</p>
